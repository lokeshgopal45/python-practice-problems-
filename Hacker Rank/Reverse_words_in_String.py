"""
Given a String S, reverse the string without reversing its individual words. Words are separated by dots.
Example 1:
Input:                              Output:
S = i.like.this.program.very.much   much.very.program.this.like.i

Explanation: After reversing the whole string(not individual words), the input string becomes
much.very.program.this.like.i

Example 2:
Input:              Output:
S = pqr.mno         mno.pqr
Explanation: After reversing the whole string , the input string becomes
mno.pqr

Your Task:
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function reverseWords() which takes string S as input parameter
returns a string containing the words in reversed order.
Each word in the returning string should also be separated by '.'
